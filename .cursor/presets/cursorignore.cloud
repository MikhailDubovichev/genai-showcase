# .cursorignore preset — CLOUD-RAG focus
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PURPOSE
# Use this preset when you are actively working on the cloud RAG service.
# It excludes edge-server, Gradio UIs, and infra files from Cursor's context to
# reduce noise and keep the assistant focused on cloud development. Copy or
# symlink this file to repo-root `.cursorignore` when focusing on cloud tasks.
#
# IMPORTANT: Cursor only reads the root-level `.cursorignore`. Files under
# `.cursor/presets/` are templates only; they have no effect until copied to
# the root as `.cursorignore`.

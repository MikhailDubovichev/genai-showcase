# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PURPOSE
# Use this when actively working on the cloud RAG service (milestones M2–M6).
# It excludes edge-server, Gradio UIs, and infra files from Cursor's context to
# reduce noise and keep the assistant focused on cloud development.

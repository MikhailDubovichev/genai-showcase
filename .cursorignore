# .cursorignore â€” Active focus: M1 (Monorepo restructure)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PURPOSE
# We are currently on M1 (see TASKS.md): creating monorepo structure and moving
# the existing edge-server code under `apps/edge-server/`. During M1 we want to
# keep the current codebase visible, while excluding future cloud/gradio/infra
# directories that may be created but are not yet under active development.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Ignore future cloud/gradio/infra trees if/when they appear, to keep focus

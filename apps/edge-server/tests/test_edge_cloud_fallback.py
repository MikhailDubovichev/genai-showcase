"""
Test module for edge server cloud-first with fallback integration.

This module contains integration tests that validate the edge server's ability to:
- Use cloud RAG when the feature flag is enabled
- Fall back gracefully to local LLM when cloud times out or fails
- Maintain service availability during cloud outages

The tests simulate real-world scenarios where the cloud service might be unavailable
or slow, ensuring the edge server remains responsive for end users.

def get_edge_base_url() -> str:
    """
    Get the base URL for the edge server using dynamic configuration.

    This helper function reads the edge server port from the application configuration
    to ensure tests use the same port as the running service. It first checks for
    a port setting in the config.json server section, then falls back to environment variables,
    and finally uses a default port of 8080.

    The dynamic URL resolution ensures that tests work correctly whether the service
    is running on the default port or a custom port specified in configuration or
    environment variables. This is particularly important for integration tests that
    need to communicate with the actual running service.

    Returns:
        str: Base URL for the edge server (e.g., "http://localhost:8080")

    Test edge server cloud-first behavior with simulated timeout and fallback.

    This integration test validates the edge server's resilience and fallback mechanism
    by simulating a scenario where the cloud RAG service is unavailable due to timeout.
    The test temporarily configures the edge server to:
    - Enable cloud RAG feature flag
    - Set an extremely short timeout (0.1s) that will cause cloud requests to fail
    - Attempt a request that should trigger the cloud path and then fallback

    The test verifies that:
    - The edge server attempts the cloud path (feature flag enabled)
    - The cloud request times out due to the short timeout
    - The edge server falls back to the local LLM path seamlessly
    - The response is valid and comes from the local LLM (no cloud-specific fields)
    - The service remains responsive despite cloud unavailability

    This ensures production resilience and user experience continuity during cloud outages.
